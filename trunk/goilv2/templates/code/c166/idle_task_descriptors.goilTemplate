# Generation of the idle task static and dynamic descriptor
#
# For a one core configuration, one idle task desciptor pair is generated.
# The static descriptor is named idle_task_stat_desc and the dynamic descriptor
# is named idle_task_desc
#
# For a multiple core configuration, as many idle task descriptor pairs as
# cores are generated. The static descriptors are named
# idle_task_<num>_stat_desc and the dynamic descriptors are named
# idle_<num>_task_desc where <num> is the core identifier.
