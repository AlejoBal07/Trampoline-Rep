Starting Viper2 :

* Viper2 works with pygame (Viper2 doesn't check a pygame installation yet).
Install pygame with the python version required.

* Make your application with config.py (with Ecus...)

* Launch Viper2 by "python viper2.py -g -c" (Viper2 check AUTOMATICLY the python version, modify the include/library path of python in the makefile and make the libraries for Trampoline and Viper2 with "make all")

* Clean Viper2 (before a commit for example) by "python viper2.py -m"
