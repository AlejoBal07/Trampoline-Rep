AVR sample project for AVR (AT90CAN128, but it should not be difficult to target 
To build the example, you can use makefile or an AVR Studio project.

[Makefile]
* you should adapt your OIL file to your specific installation of avr-gcc (COMPILER, LINKER and ASSEMBLER keys in the CPU/OS section).
* Then build oil related generated .c and .h files and the Makefile:
goil --target=avr -g -i --templates=../../goil/templates/ firstAVR.oil
* Finally:
make
Both a .elf and a .hex files are generated.

[AVR Studio]

Go to the AVRStudio directory.
* run the 'runGoil.bat' command file to generate .c and .h files related to the .oil file (you should select the oil file in this directory). 
NOTE: This command file SHOULD be called each time that the .oil file is updated.
* open the AVR Studio project file and compile. That's all.
(The only specific thing in the project settings is related to include directories.
